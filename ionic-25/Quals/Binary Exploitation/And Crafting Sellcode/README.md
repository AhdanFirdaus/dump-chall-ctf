# And Crafting Sellcode

**Value:** 983

**Category:** Binary Exploitation

**Description:**
Welcome to our shellcode crafting workshop! We've implemented a state-of-the-art security filter to protect against malicious code. Your mission is simple: craft shellcode that spawns a shell and read the flag.
But here's the twist... something seems off with our filter. The letter 'h' keeps disappearing from everything! Even our challenge title got affected - it's "Sellcode" instead of "Shellcode"! ðŸ¤”
Can you figure out what's being filtered and craft a working payload despite the restrictions?
