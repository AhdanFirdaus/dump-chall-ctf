# From Z3ro to Z3ro

**Value:** 847

**Category:** Reverse Engineering

**Description:**
In the digital void, where nothing exists, a journey begins...

From absolute zero, no knowledge, no secrets, no trace.
Through layers of obfuscation and computed chaos.
Back to zero, where the flag reveals itself from scattered fragments.

They said you can't find what doesn't exist.
They said you can't trace what was never written.
But everything leaves a trail, even numbers that dance back to their origin.

The path is clear: from z3ro, build the truth, return to z3ro.
