# HAF Encryptor

**Value**: 100

**Description**: I was given an assignment by my lecturer to create a final project for cryptography course. Here I made a cryptography tool based on references from 2 ciphers, so I named this tool **HAF Encryptor**. However, the problem is that I'm having trouble creating a tool to decrypt it. Can you help me make it?
